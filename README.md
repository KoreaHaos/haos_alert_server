# Red Green Alert Server!

A simple node.js server that allows a communication between two browsers for signalling a problem.

# Haos Alert Server

I needed someway for someone to let me know if my around the world presentation went south...

Thus, a simple node comm. server that runs on Cloud9!

Try it out, on a new Cloud9 VM, demo with:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/KoreaHaos/haos_alert_server.git
cd haos_alert_server/
sudo npm install
node server.js
```

or

```bash
bash runme.bash 
```

in whatever directory you cloned the repo.

Works on a fresh C9 VM. Anything else, run your own risk...
